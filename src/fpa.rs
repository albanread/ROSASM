//! The FPA instruction set, and what of it VFP can express.
//!
//! The sources were written for the Floating Point Accelerator: eight
//! registers `f0`-`f7`, and instructions that name the precision they work in.
//! A Cortex-A72 has no FPA. It has VFP and Advanced SIMD, so the FPA
//! instructions have to become VFP ones — where that is possible at all.
//!
//! It is not always possible, and the difference matters:
//!
//! * **Single and double** map exactly. `ADFS` rounds to single and so does
//!   `VADD.F32`; `LDFD` moves eight bytes and so does `VLDR` on a `d`
//!   register. These are translations, and 270 of the corpus's 598 FPA sites
//!   are of this kind.
//! * **Extended precision** has no VFP format at all. The FPA's `E` operations
//!   work to about 64 bits of mantissa and store 12 bytes; VFP's widest is a
//!   64-bit double with 53. Rewriting `STFE` as `VSTR` would silently drop
//!   bits, and the code that uses it — `fma`, `atan2`, `log1p` in the C
//!   library's `mathasm` — exists precisely to not drop them. Those routines
//!   need porting, not translating, so they are refused here by name.
//! * **Transcendentals** (`SIN`, `LOG`, `POW`, ...) were FPA instructions and
//!   are library calls everywhere else. There is nothing to translate to.
//! * **`LFM`/`SFM`** transfer registers in the FPA's internal 12-byte format,
//!   so they are the extended-precision problem again.
//! * **Packed decimal** (`LDFP`, `STFP`) has no equivalent in anything.
//!
//! ## Which register is `f3`?
//!
//! An FPA register holds one value, so the mapping has to give each `f<n>` one
//! place to live: `f<n>` becomes `d<n>`, and a single-precision operation uses
//! `s<2n>`, the low half of that same `d<n>`. Nothing collides — `s1`, `s3`,
//! `s5` and so on are left unused — and a register written as a single and
//! read as a single comes back unchanged, which is what the convertible subset
//! does. Code that writes one precision and reads another is doing a deliberate
//! conversion, and in this corpus that always involves `E`, which is refused.
//!
//! ## Sizes change
//!
//! Every FPA instruction is one word. `CMF` is not: the FPA set the ARM flags
//! directly, while `VCMP` sets the FPSCR and a following `VMRS` copies them
//! across. So a compare becomes two instructions, and the location counter has
//! to know that before the encoder ever runs — which is why `words` exists and
//! why layout consults it during expansion.

// ```
