//! Turning the encoder's fixups into AOF relocation directives.
//!
//! LLVM and the RISC OS linker disagree about what a relocatable field holds
//! before it is relocated, so the addend has to be rewritten as the object is
//! translated.
//!
//! ELF on ARM uses `REL` relocations, whose addend sits in the field itself.
//! For a branch, LLVM stores −8: the linker's rule is `S + A − P`, and −8
//! cancels the pipeline bias so the branch lands on `S`.
//!
//! AOF's rule for a PC-relative field, from `docs/DDE/CodeStds/AOF`, is
//!
//! ```text
//!     subject_field += relocation_value − base_of_area_containing(field)
//! ```
//!
//! which is measured from the base of the *area*, not from the field. So for a
//! branch at offset `off` in its area, targeting a symbol whose value is `S`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     target = area_base + off + 8 + final_field
//!            = area_base + off + 8 + stored + (S − area_base)
//! ```
//!
//! and requiring `target == S` gives `stored = −off − 8`. In other words the
//! stored addend must additionally count back to the area's base, which is
//! exactly `llvm_addend − off`.
//!
//! A branch to a label in the *same* area needs no relocation at all: the
//! distance between two points in one area cannot change.
