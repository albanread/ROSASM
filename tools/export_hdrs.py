"""Build the header tree the RISC OS build's `export_hdrs` phase produces.

    export_hdrs.py <RiscOS dir> [--build BCM2835] [--dest DIR]

Most components cannot be assembled from a clean checkout, because the headers
they `GET` do not exist until the build has run its export phase. That phase is
not a copy of every `hdr/` directory -- it is an explicit, declared list, and
the difference matters. Two components may each have an `hdr/Options` and only
one of them exports it; guessing by union picks a winner at random.

What the real build does, from `Env/!Common,feb`:

    set Hdr$Path  hdr.,<Hdr$Dir>.Global.,<Hdr$Dir>.Interface.,<Hdr$Dir>.Interface2.

Four places, searched in that order:

* `hdr.` is the component's own directory, so a private header always wins.
* `Global` is filled by `HdrSrc`, whose Makefile lists every file by name --
  about sixty of them, several parameterised by the build: `Machine.<Machine>`,
  `HALSize.<HALSize>`, `ImageSize.<ImageSize>`, `APCS.<APCS>`, `UserIF.<UserIF>`.
* `Interface` is filled by each component declaring what it exports. There are
  three spellings, because there are three standard makefile fragments:
  `AAsmModule` reads `HEADER1`..`HEADER8`, `CModule` reads `ASMHDRS` as a
  space-separated list, and a component with a long list writes `EXPORTS`
  instead, as the Kernel does for its twenty. All three copy from `hdr.`.
* `Interface2` is created and never written to. It stays empty here too.

Together that is 61 global and 71 interface headers for a BCM2835 build.

The parameterised names are why a checkout alone cannot satisfy
`GET Hdr:HALSize.<HALSize>`: the filename is built from a build variable, and
those live in `Env/ROOL/<build>`, which this reads rather than hardcodes.

Two things are reported rather than guessed at. Four components have an
`export_hdrs_custom` rule doing something no pattern describes. And three
headers -- `ADFSErr`, `RAMFSErr`, `SCSIFSErr` -- are not copied at all: the
build assembles `s.<name>` and links it `-bin` into a text file, so they exist
only after a build step this does not run.
