"""Build the RISC OS build's own utilities to run natively.

    hosttools.py --list
    hosttools.py tokenise

The build does not only assemble and link. It runs a dozen small utilities
that turn one kind of file into another, and some of their output is source
that the assembler then reads -- the Kernel's `s.TokHelpSrc` is made by
running `tokenise` over `HelpStrs`, and without it the Kernel cannot be
assembled at all.

Those utilities ship in `Library/Build` as ARM binaries, which is no use on a
development machine. But most of them have source, in the `BuildHost` product
tree, as git submodules of `RiscOS/Tools/Sources`. They are small, plain C --
`tokenise` is 440 lines of stdio and string.h with no libraries -- and they
compile and run natively as they stand.

## What is here, and what is not

The GNU ports under `Tools/Sources/GNU` -- gawk, sed, grep, diff, find, flex,
bison -- are RISC OS builds of tools a development machine already has. They
are listed for completeness and never built.

The DDE tools are in no repository, because the DDE is closed source. They are
not a gap to be filled by fetching something -- they are the work: `objasm` is
one of them and this project is its replacement, `cc` is roscc in the parent
tree, and `link` is the next one that matters, since nothing past an object
file happens without it. `romlinker`, which joins linked modules into a ROM,
does have source and is already cloned alongside these.

## Building them

Two allowances are made for source written for Norcroft in the eighties, and
neither changes what the program does:

* `memset(tokens, NULL, sizeof tokens)` passes a pointer where a fill byte
  belongs. It is zero either way, and clang's refusal is downgraded rather
  than the upstream source being edited.
* `printf("%d", size)` on a `size_t`, on an allocation-failure path.

Nothing here modifies the checked-out sources: they are submodules of an
upstream repository, and a local edit would be lost or confusing.
