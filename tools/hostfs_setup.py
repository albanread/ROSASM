"""Lay out RPCEmu's HostFS directory from the RISC OS distribution archives.

    hostfs_setup.py [--dest DIR] [--dry-run] [archive.zip ...]

The emulator serves `hostfs/` to RISC OS as `HostFS::HostFS.$`, and the
differential harness assembles on the far side of it: it needs a bootable
RISC OS and the DDE's ObjAsm sitting in there.

A plain unzip will not do, because a RISC OS file carries a filetype and a
plain extract drops it. Without the filetype `!Boot` is not an Obey file and
`objasm` is not a program, so nothing runs.

## What the archives carry

Every entry has an `AC` extra field (id 0x4341), twenty bytes: the signature
`ARC0`, then the load and exec addresses and the attributes. The filetype
lives in the load address, which is how RISC OS has always carried it:

    load & 0xFFF00000 == 0xFFF00000  ->  filetype = (load >> 8) & 0xFFF

and anything else is a raw load/exec pair, for a file that is loaded at an
address rather than typed.

## What HostFS expects on the host

From `hostfs.c`, which is the authority here:

* a typed file is `leafname,xxx`, the filetype in lowercase hex;
* an untyped one is `leafname,load-exec`, both in lowercase hex;
* a name with no comma reads back as text, 0xFFF.

The path mapping is already done by the archives. RISC OS separates
directories with `.` and allows `/` inside a name, so `$.AcornC/C++.!SetPaths`
is stored as `AcornC.C++/!SetPaths` -- which is exactly HostFS's own swap of
`.` and `/`. The names come out of the zip usable as they stand, and only the
suffix has to be added.
