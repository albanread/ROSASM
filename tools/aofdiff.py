"""Assemble a unit both ways and compare the objects, byte for byte.

    aofdiff.py <RiscOS dir> <unit> [--build BCM2835] [--keep] [-n count]
    aofdiff.py <RiscOS dir> --all [--limit N]

Every other measure this project takes is a proxy. A unit that assembles may
have assembled wrongly; two hundred instructions go out as zero words with
nothing checking them; a listing that matches line for line can still carry
the wrong bytes in the byte column. The only test that answers the question
directly is to hand the same source to ObjAsm and to rosasm and compare what
comes out.

ObjAsm runs on the far side of the emulator, where it always has. What is new
is that it is asked for an object rather than a listing, and that the two
objects are compared by content rather than by eye -- see `aofdump --against`,
which hashes everything a compiler is responsible for and diffs only where the
hashes disagree.

## What has to match, and what does not

The bytes of each area, their attributes, the relocations and the symbols. Not
the identification string, which names the tool; not the chunk order, which the
specification leaves open and which the C compiler and the assembler already
differ on.

## Getting the source there and the object back

The staging directory is `xd` at the HostFS root and the export tree is `xh`,
both short, because a RISC OS command line is truncated at 256 bytes and a
component's own path eats most of it. The predefines go in a via-file for the
same reason: there are fourteen of them and `-via` reads arguments from a file.

HostFS buffers its writes, so the emulator returns to the `*` prompt before
Windows can see the object. Waiting for the file to appear is not optional; it
is what stopped 213 of 259 units being misreported as failures once already.
